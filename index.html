  <h1>Kam's Box Model V.1</h1>
    <p>This is my first attempt at making the CSS box model so we will see how it goes. I am hoping to learn how to do this seamlessly. So that I am able to eventually make what I need for when I want to make a website. I know it will be a learning process and I am ready for it. </p>
    <p> The overall goal is to be able to implement CSS to my HTML structures to make them better than just vanilla layouts. Overall you would want your website to standout and be one that people remember. If your website is boring and not much going on, or havbing too much going on you can steer people away.</p>
